### Example
```perl
use Data::Dumper;
use WebService::Fastly::VclDiffApi;
my $api_instance = WebService::Fastly::VclDiffApi->new(

    # Configure API key authorization: token
    api_key => {'Fastly-Key' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'},
    # uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
    #api_key_prefix => {'Fastly-Key' => 'Bearer'},
);

my $service_id = "service_id_example"; # string | Alphanumeric string identifying the service.
my $from_version_id = 1; # int | The version number of the service to which changes in the generated VCL are being compared. Can either be a positive number from 1 to your maximum version or a negative number from -1 down (-1 is latest version etc).
my $to_version_id = 2; # int | The version number of the service from which changes in the generated VCL are being compared. Uses same numbering scheme as `from`.
my $format = 'text'; # string | Optional method to format the diff field.

eval {
    my $result = $api_instance->vcl_diff_service_versions(service_id => $service_id, from_version_id => $from_version_id, to_version_id => $to_version_id, format => $format);
    print Dumper($result);
};
if ($@) {
    warn "Exception when calling VclDiffApi->vcl_diff_service_versions: $@\n";
}
