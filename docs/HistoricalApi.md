# **get_hist_stats**
> HistoricalStatsByServiceResponse get_hist_stats(from => $from, to => $to, by => $by, region => $region)

Get historical stats

Fetches historical stats for each of your Fastly services and groups the results by service ID.

### Example
```perl
use Data::Dumper;
use WebService::Fastly::HistoricalApi;
my $api_instance = WebService::Fastly::HistoricalApi->new(

    # Configure API key authorization: token
    api_key => {'Fastly-Key' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'},
    # uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
    #api_key_prefix => {'Fastly-Key' => 'Bearer'},
);

my $from = 2020-04-09T18:14:30Z; # string | Timestamp that defines the start of the window for which to fetch statistics, including the timestamp itself. Accepts Unix timestamps, or any form of input parsable by the [Chronic Ruby library](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic), such as 'yesterday', or 'two weeks ago'. Default varies based on the value of `by`. 
my $to = 2020-04-09T18:14:30Z; # string | Timestamp that defines the end of the window for which to fetch statistics. Accepts the same formats as `from`. 
my $by = day; # string | Duration of sample windows. One of:   * `hour` - Group data by hour.   * `minute` - Group data by minute.   * `day` - Group data by day. 
my $region = usa; # string | Limit query to a specific geographic region. One of:   * `usa` - North America.   * `europe` - Europe.   * `anzac` - Australia and New Zealand.   * `asia` - Asia.   * `asia_india` - India.   * `asia_southkorea` - South Korea.   * `africa_std` - Africa.   * `mexico` - Mexico.   * `southamerica_std` - South America.

# **get_usage_month**
> HistoricalUsageMonthResponse get_usage_month(year => $year, month => $month, billable_units => $billable_units)

Get month-to-date usage statistics

Returns month-to-date usage details for a given month and year. Usage details are aggregated by service and across all Fastly services, and then grouped by region. This endpoint does not use the `from` or `to` fields for selecting the date for which data is requested. Instead, it uses `month` and `year` integer fields. Both fields are optional and default to the current month and year respectively. When set, an optional `billable_units` field will convert bandwidth to GB and divide requests by 10,000.

### Example
```perl
use Data::Dumper;
use WebService::Fastly::HistoricalApi;
my $api_instance = WebService::Fastly::HistoricalApi->new(

    # Configure API key authorization: token
    api_key => {'Fastly-Key' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'},
    # uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
    #api_key_prefix => {'Fastly-Key' => 'Bearer'},
);

my $year = 2020; # string | 4-digit year.
my $month = 05; # string | 2-digit month.
my $billable_units = true; # boolean | If `true`, return results as billable units.

eval {
    my $result = $api_instance->get_usage_month(year => $year, month => $month, billable_units => $billable_units);
    print Dumper($result);
};
if ($@) {
    warn "Exception when calling HistoricalApi->get_usage_month: $@\n";
}
```

# **get_usage_service**
> HistoricalUsageServiceResponse get_usage_service(from => $from, to => $to)

Get usage statistics per service

Returns usage information aggregated by service and grouped by service and region. For service stats by time period, see [`/stats`](#get-hist-stats) and [`/stats/field/:field`](#get-hist-stats-field).

### Example
```perl
use Data::Dumper;
use WebService::Fastly::HistoricalApi;
my $api_instance = WebService::Fastly::HistoricalApi->new(

    # Configure API key authorization: token
    api_key => {'Fastly-Key' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'},
    # uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
    #api_key_prefix => {'Fastly-Key' => 'Bearer'},
);

my $from = 2020-04-09T18:14:30Z; # string | Timestamp that defines the start of the window for which to fetch statistics, including the timestamp itself. Accepts Unix timestamps, or any form of input parsable by the [Chronic Ruby library](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic), such as 'yesterday', or 'two weeks ago'. Default varies based on the value of `by`. 
my $to = 2020-04-09T18:14:30Z; # string | Timestamp that defines the end of the window for which to fetch statistics. Accepts the same formats as `from`. 

eval {
    my $result = $api_instance->get_usage_service(from => $from, to => $to);
    print Dumper($result);
};
if ($@) {
    warn "Exception when calling HistoricalApi->get_usage_service: $@\n";
}
```
